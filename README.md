# SpaceX-Facebook-Hackathon-AR

#Inspiration
Space exploration, in essence, is pure curiosity and the urge for survival. On May 30th, SpaceX and NASA made history with the launch of Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket to the ISS. It’s one of the most important missions in human history as it was the first time, a reusable rocket was used in a mission sending astronauts to orbit. The F9 B5 carried the astronauts from Kennedy Space Centre to the International Space Station. The whole mission was a remarkable idea on paper which came to fruition.

#What it does
Our filter explores the journey and tries to visualize it with 3D models and animation. We wanted to simulate the experience and also teach about the mission to others. AR is one of the best tools for teaching topics that can be better explained visually. Anyone with access to Instagram or Facebook will be able to visualize and understand this piece of history using this filter.

#How we built it
SparkAR was used as the filter builder and we designed the 3D models in Blender.
Challenges we ran into
1.	Stabilization of the filter
2.	Using animations in Spark AR

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud of being able to choreograph this piece of history into a medium that is one step higher than watching a video and showing the capability of AR in learning.

#What we learned
It was a profound learning experience for us to build something from scratch. We also learnt about how hard it is to make a polished filter. By trying to simulate the mission, we came to know about how previous launches stacked up to this one.

#What's next for SpaceX Crew Dragon AR
We plan to make the whole experience more intricate and detailed as possible.
